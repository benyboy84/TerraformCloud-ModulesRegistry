# Terraform Cloud Foundation

Code which manages configuration and life-cycle of all the Terraform Cloud
module in the private registry. It is designed to be used from a dedicated
VCS-Driven Terraform Cloud workspace that would provision and manage the
configuration using Terraform code (IaC).

## Permissions

To manage the module in the private registry from that code, provide a token
from an account with `manage modules` access. Alternatively, you can use a
token from a team with that access instead of a user token.

## Authentication

The Terraform Cloud provider requires a Terraform Cloud/Enterprise API token in
order to manage resources.

- Set the `TFE_TOKEN` environment variable: The provider can read the TFE\_TOKEN environment variable and the token stored there
to authenticate. Refer to [Managing Variables](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cloud-docs/workspaces/variables/managing-variables) documentation for more details.

## Features

- Manages configuration and life-cycle of Terraform Cloud resources:
  - private module registry

## Prerequisite

In order to deploy the configuration from this code, you must first create
a VCS-Driven workspace in Terraform Cloud. This workspace mut contain an
environment variable `TFE_TOKEN`.

You can use the code from the [TerraformCloud\_Foundation](https://github.com/benyboy84/TerraformCloud_Foundation) repository.
